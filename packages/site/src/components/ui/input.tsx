/**
 * This is a `<div>` that we style as an `<input>` since the readonly input had an issue on iOS
 * that I couldn't fix. When you tapped the input to focus it, the autofill and share menu
 * would pop up at the top of the screen instead of over the input. There was a StackOverflow
 * about it but nothing would work: https://stackoverflow.com/q/70199584
 * 
 * Also, on Firefox desktop: selecting text in the input, clicking off the input, and clicking
 * back on would cause the selection to reappear for a second before disappearing which didn't
 * look nice at all. Both of these issues happened with an unstyled `<input>` tag, so I've
 * just gone with a `<div>` instead.
